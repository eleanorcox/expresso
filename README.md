## Project Overview

In this project I built the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a coffee shop called Expresso.

The Expresso internal tool allows users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete menus
- Create, view, update, and delete menu items
- Create, view, update, and delete employees
- Create, view, update, and delete employee's timesheets

## To Run

Run `npm install`.
If you would like extra data to interact with, run `node seed.js` to seed the database.
Run `node server.js` to start the server.
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Testing

To run the testing suite, run `npm run test`. This project is in a completed state and hence all tests pass.
